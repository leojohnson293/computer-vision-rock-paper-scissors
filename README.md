# Computer Vision: Rock-Paper-Scissors
> Rock-paper-Scissors is a two- player game where players make a shape with their hand that represents either rock, paper or scissors and they win based on what shape they and the opposing player made. For example, a player that chooses rock will win if their oppenent chooses scissors but lose if they chose paper. In the same way, if a player chooses scissors wil win if the oppenent chooses paper but lose if they chose rock.

## Milestone 2

In this milestone, I used the Teachable-Machine website to create the model that recognises the hand gesture that represents either rock, paper or scissors using the camera. the model is trained by taking multiple pictures of my hand and making each gesture at different positions on the camera. The more pictures that are taken, the more accurately the camera can recognise each gesture. This model will be used in the project, for the python code, the recognise each gesture when playing the game.
